## Usage

**This repository is a quick reference guide** — not a replacement for authoritative sources. When making critical decisions or implementing solutions:

1. **Consult official external resources**: Vendor documentation, standards bodies (ISO, NIST, OWASP), and regulatory requirements
2. **Follow internal enterprise resources**: Your organization's policies, architecture standards, and governance frameworks
3. **Adhere to project/team conventions**: Code patterns, coding standards, architectural guidelines, and team workflows specific to your context

> **Remember**: Always validate information against authoritative sources and align with your organization's established practices and protocols.
