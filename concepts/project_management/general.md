## 1. Project Fundamentals

### Project vs Operations

- **Project**: temporary, unique outcome, defined start/end, creates change
- **Operations**: ongoing, repetitive, maintains status quo

### Project Success Criteria

- **Traditional**: on time, on budget, within scope
- **Modern**: stakeholder satisfaction, business value delivered, quality standards met, team health maintained

### Project Constraints

- **Triple constraint**: scope, time, cost (quality often added as fourth)
- **Other constraints**: resources, risk tolerance, regulatory requirements, organizational culture

---

## 2. Project Lifecycle

### Phases (Traditional)

1. **Initiation**: project charter, stakeholder identification, feasibility
2. **Planning**: detailed planning, WBS, schedules, budgets, risk register
3. **Execution**: deliver work, manage team, communicate status
4. **Monitoring & Controlling**: track progress, manage changes, control risks
5. **Closing**: final deliverables, lessons learned, resource release

### Modern Approach

- **Iterative cycles**: plan → execute → review → adapt (regardless of methodology)
- **Continuous planning**: detailed planning for near-term, high-level for long-term
- **Value delivery focus**: prioritize early value delivery over comprehensive upfront planning

---

## 3. Triple Constraint & Trade-offs

### Core Constraints

- **Scope**: what will be delivered
- **Time**: when it will be delivered
- **Cost**: budget/resources available

### Trade-off Principles

- **Fixed scope**: time/cost may vary
- **Fixed time**: scope/cost may vary
- **Fixed cost**: scope/time may vary
- **Reality**: all three are usually constrained; quality is the variable (often hidden)

### Modern Perspective

- **Value over scope**: deliver highest value first, adjust scope based on learnings
- **Time-boxing**: fixed time, flexible scope (Agile principle)
- **Cost awareness**: optimize for value per dollar, not just total cost

---

## 4. Scope Management

### Scope Definition

- **Product scope**: features, functions, characteristics of deliverables
- **Project scope**: work required to deliver product scope
- **Scope creep**: uncontrolled expansion of project scope

### Scope Management Process

1. **Collect requirements**: stakeholder needs, business objectives
2. **Define scope**: scope statement, deliverables, acceptance criteria
3. **Create WBS**: work breakdown structure (hierarchical decomposition)
4. **Validate scope**: formal acceptance of deliverables
5. **Control scope**: manage scope changes through change control

### Best Practices

- **Clear acceptance criteria**: measurable, testable, agreed-upon
- **Change control process**: formal process for scope changes (impact assessment, approval)
- **Say no gracefully**: explain trade-offs, propose alternatives, escalate when needed
- **Document assumptions**: explicit assumptions reduce scope ambiguity

---

## 5. Risk Management

### Risk vs Issue

- **Risk**: uncertain event that may impact objectives (future, probability-based)
- **Issue**: current problem that needs resolution (present, fact-based)

### Risk Management Process

1. **Identify risks**: brainstorming, checklists, lessons learned, expert judgment
2. **Analyze risks**: probability × impact (qualitative/quantitative)
3. **Plan responses**: avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept
4. **Implement responses**: execute risk response plans
5. **Monitor risks**: track risk register, identify new risks, reassess existing

### Risk Response Strategies

- **Avoid**: eliminate threat (change plan, remove scope)
- **Mitigate**: reduce probability or impact (contingency plans, early actions)
- **Transfer**: shift to third party (insurance, contracts, outsourcing)
- **Accept**: acknowledge and monitor (passive) or create contingency (active)

### Modern Practices

- **Positive risks (opportunities)**: exploit, enhance, share, accept
- **Risk appetite**: organizational tolerance for risk; align responses accordingly
- **Continuous risk management**: not just upfront; ongoing throughout project
- **Psychological safety**: encourage risk identification without blame

---

## 6. Stakeholder Management

### Stakeholder Identification

- **Power/Interest grid**: map stakeholders by influence and interest
- **Stakeholder register**: document stakeholders, roles, expectations, influence
- **Key stakeholders**: sponsor, end users, project team, executives, regulators
- **Enterprise hierarchies**: understand organizational structure, reporting lines, decision-making authority
- **Executive sponsors**: C-level champions, steering committee members, budget approvers

### Stakeholder Engagement

- **Engagement levels**: unaware, resistant, neutral, supportive, leading
- **Engagement strategy**: move stakeholders to desired engagement level
- **Communication tailored**: frequency and format based on stakeholder needs

### Best Practices

- **Early engagement**: involve stakeholders in planning, not just execution
- **Manage expectations**: set realistic expectations, communicate trade-offs
- **Stakeholder analysis**: regularly reassess stakeholder influence and interest
- **Conflict resolution**: address conflicts early, use structured approaches

---

## 7. Communication Management

### Communication Planning

- **Stakeholder needs**: what information, when, how, from whom
- **Communication matrix**: who needs what, frequency, format, owner
- **Channels**: meetings, reports, dashboards, emails, collaboration tools

### Communication Principles

- **Right message, right audience, right time**: avoid information overload
- **Transparency**: honest status reporting (bad news early)
- **Consistency**: regular cadence, predictable format
- **Two-way**: encourage feedback, questions, concerns

### Modern Practices

- **Asynchronous first**: documentation, async updates; meetings for collaboration
- **Visual dashboards**: status at a glance, real-time metrics
- **Transparent roadmaps**: visible priorities, dependencies, blockers
- **Blame-free reporting**: focus on facts, impacts, next steps (not blame)

## 8. Change Management

### Change Control Process

1. **Request change**: formal change request (what, why, impact)
2. **Assess impact**: scope, time, cost, quality, resources, risks
3. **Decision**: approve, reject, defer (by change control board/authority)
4. **Implement**: update plans, communicate, execute
5. **Track**: monitor change implementation, verify outcomes

### Organizational Change Management

- **ADKAR model**: Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement
- **Kotter's 8-step process**: create urgency, build coalition, form vision, communicate, empower, generate wins, sustain, anchor
- **Change impact assessment**: people, processes, systems, culture
- **Resistance management**: identify resistance, address concerns, build support
- **Training & enablement**: skills development, knowledge transfer, support systems

### Change Types

- **Scope changes**: new features, modified requirements
- **Schedule changes**: timeline adjustments, milestone shifts
- **Resource changes**: team changes, budget adjustments
- **Process changes**: methodology shifts, tool changes

### Best Practices

- **Change control board**: clear authority for change decisions
- **Impact assessment**: always assess before approving (avoid scope creep)
- **Documentation**: all changes documented, rationale captured
- **Balance**: not all changes are bad; some are necessary for success

## 9. Quality Management

### Quality vs Grade

- **Quality**: degree to which deliverables meet requirements (must meet)
- **Grade**: category/rank of deliverables (can vary by design)

### Quality Management Process

1. **Plan quality**: quality standards, metrics, acceptance criteria
2. **Assure quality**: processes to ensure quality standards met
3. **Control quality**: verify deliverables meet requirements (testing, reviews)

### Quality Principles

- **Prevention over inspection**: build quality in, don't inspect it out
- **Continuous improvement**: learn from defects, improve processes
- **Customer focus**: quality defined by customer/stakeholder satisfaction
- **Right quality level**: not perfectionism; quality appropriate for context

### Modern Practices

- **Shift-left testing**: test early, test often, automate where possible
- **Definition of Done**: clear, shared understanding of completion criteria
- **Quality metrics**: defect rates, rework, customer satisfaction, technical debt
- **Quality culture**: everyone owns quality, not just QA team

## 10. Resource Management

### Resource Planning

- **Resource requirements**: skills, roles, quantities, timing
- **Resource allocation**: assign resources to tasks, balance workload
- **Resource constraints**: availability, skills, cost, location

### Resource Management Process

1. **Estimate resources**: what resources needed, when, how much
2. **Acquire resources**: hire, assign, procure
3. **Develop team**: training, coaching, team building
4. **Manage team**: performance, conflict, motivation, recognition
5. **Release resources**: transition out, knowledge transfer

### Best Practices

- **Right person, right role**: match skills to tasks, consider growth opportunities
- **Workload balance**: avoid over-allocation, plan for capacity
- **Team development**: invest in skills, cross-training, knowledge sharing
- **Recognition**: acknowledge contributions, celebrate wins

- **Funding requirements**: cash flow planning, milestone-based funding

### Cost Control

- **Earned Value Management (EVM)**: PV (planned value), EV (earned value), AC (actual cost)
- **Variance analysis**: cost variance (CV = EV - AC), schedule variance (SV = EV - PV)
- **Performance indices**: CPI (cost performance index), SPI (schedule performance index)
- **Forecasting**: EAC (estimate at completion), ETC (estimate to complete), VAC (variance at completion)

### Enterprise Cost Management

- **Capital vs operational expenses**: CapEx (one-time) vs OpEx (ongoing) budgeting
- **Chargeback/showback**: allocate costs to business units, departments, projects
- **Budget approvals**: multi-level approvals, budget change control, variance reporting
- **Financial reporting**: regular cost reports, budget status, forecast updates

### Best Practices
